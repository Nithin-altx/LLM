       "'\\nGreat, I\\'d be happy to help! Prompt templates are a powerful feature in programming languages that allow you to generate code snippets or complete programs based on user input. In Python, you can use the `input` function to prompt the user for input and then use it to generate the code. Here\\'s an example of how you can use prompt templates in Python:\\n\\nLet\\'s say you want to create a simple calculator that takes in two numbers as input and then prints out their sum. You could use a prompt template like this:\\n```\\nsum = input(\"Enter the first number: \")\\nsecond_number = input(\"Enter the second number: \")\\nprint(\"The sum is\", sum + second_number)\\n```\\nIn this code, we use the `input` function to prompt the user for two numbers. We then store each number in variables called `sum` and `second_number`. Finally, we use the `+` operator to calculate the sum of the two numbers and print it to the console.\\n\\nHere\\'s how you can use a prompt template to generate this code:\\n```\\nEnter the first number: 5\\nEnter the second number: 3\\nThe sum is 8\\n```\\nIn this example, we use the `input` function to prompt the user for two numbers, and then use a template string to generate the output. The ` input` function will return the user\\'s input as a string, which we can then use in our code.\\n\\nYou can also use more complex templates with variables and conditional statements to generate different output based on the user\\'s input. For example:\\n```\\nsum = input(\"Enter the first number: \")\\nif sum > 0:\\n    second_number = input(\"Enter the second number: \")\\n    print(\"The sum is\", sum + second_number)\\nelse:\\n    print(\"Sorry, you must enter a positive number!\")\\n```\\nIn this code, we use an `if` statement to check if the user\\'s input for the first number is positive. If it is, we prompt the user for a second number and calculate the sum. Otherwise, we print an error message to the console.\\n\\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.'"

      "The father of biology is a matter of debate among scientists and historians, as there were many influential figures in the development of the field of biology. However, some candidates who are often cited as the \"father of biology\" include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Aristotle (384-322 BCE): Aristotle was a Greek philosopher and scientist who made significant contributions to the field of biology, including the classification of living things into different species and the study of botany, zoology, and anatomy.\n",
      "2. Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778): Linnaeus was a Swedish botanist, physician, and zoologist who is known for developing the system of binomial nomenclature, which is still used today to classify living organisms. He also made significant contributions to the fields of botany, zoology, and ecology.\n",
      "3. Charles Darwin (1809-1882): Darwin was an English naturalist who is best known for his theory of evolution through natural selection. His work \"On the Origin of Species\" (1859) is considered one of the most important scientific works of the 19th century and laid the foundation for modern evolutionary biology.\n",
      "4. Gregor Mendel (1822-1884): Mendel was a Czech scientist who is known for his work on the inheritance of traits in plants, which laid the foundation for the field of genetics. His laws of inheritance and the concept of gene mutation are still widely used today.\n",
      "5. Louis Pasteur (1822-1895): Pasteur was a French chemist and microbiologist who made significant contributions to the fields of biology, medicine, and virology. He discovered the role of microorganisms in fermentation and developed the first vaccines for anthrax and rabies.\n",
      "6. Robert Hooke (1635-1703): Hooke was an English naturalist and microscopist who made significant contributions to the fields of biology, chemistry, and physics. He was one of the first scientists to study living organisms using a microscope and discovered many new species of plants and animals.\n",
      "7. John Dalton (1766-1844): Dalton was an English chemist and physicist who is known for his work on the structure of atoms and molecules. He proposed the modern atomic theory, which states that elements are composed of small, indivisible particles called atoms, and that compounds are formed when atoms of different elements combine.\n",
      "8. Charles Ébner (1768-1823): Ébner was a French naturalist who is known for his work on the classification of living things and the study of evolution. He proposed a system of classification that grouped organisms based on their morphological characteristics, rather than their habitat or geographic location.\n",
      "9. Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744-1829): Lamarck was a French biologist who is known for his work on the inheritance of acquired traits and the concept of evolution through use and disuse. He proposed that organisms can pass on any characteristics they acquire during their lifetime to their offspring, which is now known as Lamarckism.\n",
      "10. Theodor Schwann (1810-1882): Schwann was a German physiologist and biologist who made significant contributions to the fields of botany, zoology, and histology. He proposed the cell theory, which states that all living things are composed of cells, and he discovered the first nerve cells.\n",
